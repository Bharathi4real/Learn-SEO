## 1. Search engine submission review
Search engine submission is the process of notifying search engines about the presence of website content, 
enabling the site to be included in their index and become searchable by the public. 
This practice is crucial for new websites or pages seeking to ensure discoverability through search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo.
