## 2. Keyword cannibalization
Keyword cannibalization is an SEO issue that happens when multiple pages on a website target the same or similar keywords. This leads to a situation where the site’s pages compete against each other for search engine rankings. This can dilute the website’s ability to rank effectively for targeted keywords.

The trick to finding real cannibalization issues is to look for pages that target the same keywords and fulfill the same or very similar intent.

Example:

/blog/identify-and-tackle-keyword-cannibalisation-in-2019

/blog/how-to-solve-keyword-cannibalization

Here’s what they tell us about the pages:

- They’re both blog posts.
- They’re both about the same thing (i.e., tackling/solving keyword cannibalization).
- The first one is outdated (it has “2019” in the URL).
- So this is almost certainly a cannibalization issue. 
- The pages fulfill the same intent and compete against each other.

## 8. LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) keywords:
LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) keywords are terms or phrases semantically related to a primary keyword. They provide context and help search engines like Google understand the topic of a webpage by identifying concepts commonly associated with the main keyword.

Key Characteristics:
- Not always synonyms of the primary keyword
- Related to the main keyword through semantic meaning
- Help search engines understand the webpage’s topic and context
- Can improve Google’s ability to index and rank content

Example:

Suppose the primary keyword is “artificial intelligence.” LSI keywords might include:
- Machine learning
- Neural networks
- Natural language processing
- Data analysis
- Robotics

Incorporating these LSI keywords into content can enhance its relevance and visibility in search engine results.

Note: While LSI keywords are important for search engine optimization (SEO), it’s essential to use them naturally and contextually within content, avoiding keyword stuffing or manipulation.
