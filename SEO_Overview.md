## 17. Keyword Cannibalization
Keyword cannibalization is an SEO issue that happens when multiple pages on a website target the same or similar keywords. This leads to a situation where the site’s pages compete against each other for search engine rankings. This can dilute the website’s ability to rank effectively for targeted keywords.

The trick to finding real cannibalization issues is to look for pages that target the same keywords and fulfill the same or very similar intent.

![Keyword Cannibalization](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7cf39ec-e013-4ab7-bedf-981d45b0161a)

Example:

- /blog/identify-and-tackle-keyword-cannibalisation-in-2019
- /blog/how-to-solve-keyword-cannibalization

Here’s what they tell us about the pages:

- They’re both blog posts.
- They’re both about the same thing (i.e., tackling/solving keyword cannibalization).
- The first one is outdated (it has “2019” in the URL).
- So this is almost certainly a cannibalization issue. 
- The pages fulfill the same intent and compete against each other.

## 18. Keyword Density
Keyword density refers to the number of times a keyword appears on a given webpage or within a piece of content as a ratio or percentage of the overall word count. This is also sometimes referred to as keyword frequency, or the frequency with which a specific keyword appears on a webpage.

## 19. Keyword Difficulty
Keyword difficulty (or SEO difficulty) is a metric that estimates how hard it is to earn a prominent, unpaid position for a given search engine query.

For example, “iphone” has a very high difficulty score. Because it’s extremely challenging to outrank the highly relevant, high-quality search results from authoritative sites like Apple.

## 20. Keyword Research
Keyword research is the practice of identifying the words and phrases people use to find things via search engines like Google.

Learning how to do keyword research is a fundamental SEO task. When you know what your audience searches for, you can focus the content you create around those topics.

Researching keywords gives SEOs, marketers, and organizations a better understanding of how high the demand is for certain keywords and how hard it would be to compete for those terms against competitors in the search results, offering some direction to optimization efforts.

## 23. LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) Keywords
LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) keywords are terms or phrases semantically related to a primary keyword. They provide context and help search engines like Google understand the topic of a webpage by identifying concepts commonly associated with the main keyword.

Key Characteristics:
- Not always synonyms of the primary keyword
- Related to the main keyword through semantic meaning
- Help search engines understand the webpage’s topic and context
- Can improve Google’s ability to index and rank content

Example:

Suppose the primary keyword is “artificial intelligence.” LSI keywords might include:
- Machine learning
- Neural networks
- Natural language processing
- Data analysis
- Robotics

Incorporating these LSI keywords into content can enhance its relevance and visibility in search engine results.

Note: While LSI keywords are important for search engine optimization (SEO), it’s essential to use them naturally and contextually within content, avoiding keyword stuffing or manipulation.

## 24. Keyword Ranking
Keyword ranking refers to the position of a website or webpage in search engine results pages (SERPs) for a specific search query or keyword. A higher ranking indicates better visibility and increased chances of attracting organic traffic.
