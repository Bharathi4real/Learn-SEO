## 7. Domain Authority (DA) and Page Authority (PA):
- **DA (Domain Authority)**: Measures the strength of an entire website.

- **Gray Hat SEO**: Uses a combination of SEO methods that comply with Google Webmaster Guidelines (white hat SEO) and those that violate them (black hat methods). For example, creating quality content (white hat) and buying backlinks to it (black hat).

## 10. Types of SEO Techniques:
- **Local SEO**: Improves rankings for location-specific searches (e.g., "dentists in Nashville").
- **Off-page SEO**: Involves strategies outside the website to improve rankings.
- **Global SEO**: Targets a broad audience with general keywords, requiring thorough research.

Enhances individual web pages using keywords, meta descriptions, and other SEO elements.

## 13. Off-page Optimization:
Improves website rankings through external factors like backlinks and social signals.

## 14. Keywords:
